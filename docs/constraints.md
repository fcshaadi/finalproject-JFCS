# Constraints – MVP Guardrails



The following are strictly out of scope:



- No automated death trigger

- No inactivity detection

- No scheduled jobs

- No background workers

- No email notifications

- No cloud storage

- No encryption at rest

- No soft delete

- No multi-beneficiary support

- No subscription billing

- No admin panel

- No microservices



---



## Architectural Rule



The MVP must remain:



- Monolithic

- Deterministic

- Simple

- Synchronous



If a feature requires automation or async processing, it is NOT part of MVP.
