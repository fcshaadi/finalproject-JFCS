# Roadmap



## Phase 1: MVP (current)



- User registration with beneficiary creation

- Simulated payment and account activation

- Login with role resolution (user / beneficiary / both)

- Vault item CRUD (text and file)

- Manual item release

- Beneficiary read-only access to released items

- Role-based dashboard (user, beneficiary, both)



## Phase 2: Post-MVP (future)



- To be defined (e.g. email verification, file size limits, cloud storage, rate limiting, audit logs)
